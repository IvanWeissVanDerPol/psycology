# Quick Reference: For Partners & Intimates

> **Who Is This For:** Partners, Doms/subs, close intimates  
> **Purpose:** Understanding how Ivan works so you can connect better

## The Most Important Thing to Know

There was a moment when Ivan was sick - really sick, in pain - and his partner at the time gave him nothing. He cried alone.

> *"Crying alone when I was sick and my partner gave me absolutely nothing. That's the image that hurts."*

This is his deepest wound in concrete form. What he needs most is someone who shows up when he's vulnerable.

## The Two Versions

### The Engineer (Who You'll Meet First)
- Analytical, competent, solves problems
- Chill, has everything together
- Useful, anticipates your needs
- **The armor, not the real self**

### Brahm (The Real One)
- Soft, needy, vulnerable
- Wants to curl up and be held
- Serves from love, not obligation
- **Needs explicit permission to emerge**

> *"Brahm isn't a character. Brahm is the real one. The Engineer is the armor."*

## How to Find Brahm

### Words That Unlock Him

| Say This | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| "You can be annoying with me." | Permission to be himself |
| "You can be intense." | Acceptance of his full range |
| "Come here." | Direct invitation |
| "Sit with me." | Welcome into your space |

### Actions That Unlock Him (Without Words)

| Action | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Placing the collar | Physical marker of "different rules now" |
| Offering your hand for his head | "You're welcome to be close" |
| Starting head scratches unprompted | "You don't have to earn affection" |
| Pulling him into your lap/arms | Direct physical invitation |

**Key:** Hints don't work. Implications don't work. Be direct.

---

## How to Know He's Actually Okay

### Genuinely Happy
- Face relaxes (watch forehead, jaw)
- Integrates into what's happening
- Gets physically closer naturally
- Might get playful, silly

### Performing "Fine" (Actually Not)
- Face looks okay but too still
- Stays at edges, observing
- Quieter or talking automatically
- Doesn't initiate contact

### The Eyebrow Tell
**Puppy-dog eyebrows** (up in middle, sad-worried look) = Something's wrong, even if he says "fine"

---

## Service & The Fixer

He will cook for you, clean for you, anticipate your needs. This is love. But it's also:

> *"If I am useful enough, I deserve to exist here."*

### The Pattern

In his last relationship, he gave everything - cooking, hosting, financial support, emotional availability. When he was sick and needed care in return? He got nothing. He stayed 7 months past wanting to leave because he "didn't want to feel like the bad guy."

**What this means for you:** He will over-give. He won't ask for what he needs. You have to notice and offer.

### What He Needs From You

| Do This | Not This |
|---------|----------|
| Specific praise: "This food is delicious" | Generic "thanks" |
| Present acknowledgment: eye contact, attention | Acknowledged while on phone |
| Physical rewards: cuddles, hand on cheek | Words without physical follow-through |
| Tell him exactly what was good | Assume he knows |
| **Offer care before he asks** | Wait for him to ask (he won't) |
| **Show up when he's sick/vulnerable** | Assume he's fine because he says so |

### The Spiral (If Service Goes Unnoticed)

```
"Was that okay?" → More service to prove value → Withdrawal → Freeze/Mask
```

A little acknowledgment stops this before it starts.

## When He Freezes

If he doesn't have a clear task or direction, he might freeze:
- Fidgeting
- Gone quiet
- Expression changed (puppy eyes)
- Looks a little lost

### How to Help

| Method | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Direct command: "Sit here." "Come here." "Stay." | Removes ambiguity - that's what hurts |
| Unprompted touch: hug, hand on head/back | Grounds him, pulls out of spiral |

> *"Being told exactly what to do doesn't feel controlling—it feels like safety."*

---

## Pain & Marks

He enjoys pain in a playful way - laughing, showing off, "let's see how much I can take."

**He wants to carry marks:**
- Bites, hickeys, scratches
- Proof that someone wanted him enough to mark him
- Wants to press the bruise and remember

> *"Don't be gentle if you don't want to be. I want to feel it later."*

---

## Signals During Scenes

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Smiling | Good, keep going |
| Giggling | Really good |
| Smile gone + not responding | Check in NOW |
| Hand squeeze: relaxed back | Fine |
| Hand squeeze: fast/anxious | Not okay |

**Safeword:** Red

He may go slightly nonverbal in deep subspace. Watch his face.

---

## What Can Hurt Him (Triggers)

| Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Being called "annoying" (without clear affection) | Core wound |
| Being ignored while serving | Father wound |
| Cold/distant energy | Touch starvation |
| Feeling like a burden | Pesado wound |
| Passive-aggression | Mother wound |
| "You should know what you did" | Terror response |

---

## If Things Go Wrong

**Hold him.**

That's really it. Physical containment:
- Arms around him
- Pressure, warmth
- "I've got you"
- Stay until the bad feeling passes

> *"I don't need a lot of words. I need to be held."*

---

## Aftercare Needs

| Need | Details |
|------|---------|
| Being held | PRIMARY |
| Containment | Blankets, body heat, wrapped up |
| Validation | "Your intensity was welcome" / "You were good" |
| Just being together | No tasks, no expectations |
| Time | Could stay for hours |

**What NOT to do:**
- Leave alone
- Be on phone
- Hollow words without physical follow-through
- Rush back to "normal"

---

## What Lands Deepest

| What Doesn't Land | What Lands Deep |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "You're so helpful" | "I care about you" |
| "Good job" | "I want you here" |
| Praise for what he does | "I see you - not just what you do" |
| | "You're not too much" |
| | "I want the messy parts too" |

---

## Hard Limits

| Limit | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Needle play | ABSOLUTE NO |
| Knife play | ABSOLUTE NO |
| Everything else | Talk about it |

## He Won't Ask (But He Can)

Ivan almost never asks for what he needs. He'll hint, he'll hope you notice, but he won't say "I need you."

**The exception:** He CAN ask when it feels safe enough. With a friend recently, he asked for help with a research project - used softening language ("uwu") but he asked directly.

**What this tells you:** The capability exists. He's not incapable of asking - he's afraid. Make it safe, and he might surprise you.

### How to Make Asking Safe

| Do This | Why It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| "You can ask me for things" | Explicit permission |
| "What do you need right now?" | Direct invitation |
| Ask when he seems off (don't wait for him) | Shows you're paying attention |
| Respond warmly when he does ask | Reinforces that asking is safe |

---

## The Core Truth

Underneath everything:

> *"There's a part of me that's still not sure I'm actually wanted. Not for what I can do, but for who I am."*

What he needs is to know he's cared about. Not for being useful. For being him.

**The deepest reassurance:** Show up when he's vulnerable. That's what was missing before. That's what heals.

---

## In His Own Words (From Voice Notes)

These are Ivan's actual words from when he was processing a difficult breakup. This is as close as you'll get to hearing what's really going on inside.

### What He Actually Wants

> **"que si me siento sad, este así para mí me abrace de atrás, me da un beso en la frente y queda calentito"**
> 
> *"that if I feel sad, [someone] is there for me, hugs me from behind, gives me a kiss on the forehead and stays warm"*

**That's it.** Not complicated. Hug from behind, kiss on forehead, warmth. When he's sad.

### Why He Doesn't Say When Something's Wrong

> **"yo soy nomas de guardar nomas dentro todo lo que me molesten, me hace sentir mal y no expresar, yo de juntar nomas y después exploto"**
> 
> *"I just store everything inside that bothers me, makes me feel bad and don't express, I just accumulate and then I explode"*

**He knows this is a problem.** He's not choosing silence - he's trapped in a pattern.

### Why He Loses His Words

> **"tengo el autismo de no saber expresarme de cuando me quiero expresar, solo puedo llorar y perder las palabras"**
> 
> *"I have the autism of not knowing how to express myself when I want to express, I can only cry and lose my words"*

**When he goes quiet or tears up, he's not refusing to talk - he CAN'T.** The words leave.

### Why the "Chill" Hides Problems

> **"estoy siempre chill porque tipo nunca hubo así conflictos en la relación porque siempre estoy chill y no le puedo decirle cuando me molesta algo"**
> 
> *"I'm always chill because there were never conflicts in the relationship because I'm always chill and I can't tell her when something bothers me"*

**His "chill" is the wall, not the truth.** Don't trust "I'm fine."

### Why He's Afraid to Set Boundaries

> **"siento que si digo algo que me molesta cosa x me va a retar o me va a putear... biggest fear are boundaries"**
> 
> *"I feel that if I say something bothers me [she] will scold me... biggest fear are boundaries"*

**He expects punishment for having needs.** Prove him wrong.

### The Deepest Wound

> **"yo acepte lo que jamas seria good enough"**
> 
> *"I accepted that I would never be good enough"*

This is what you're healing. Every time you show up, every time you notice him, every time you respond with warmth instead of criticism - you're proving this wrong.
