# Attachment Patterns: Overview

> **Assessment:** Complex, Context-Dependent  
> **Primary Pattern:** Varies by relational context  
> **Key Feature:** Different attachment styles emerge with different people

---

## Context-Dependent Attachment

Ivan's attachment style is not monolithic. It shifts based on context:

| Context | Attachment Style | Key Features |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Family** | Dismissive-Avoidant | Information Firewall, emotional distance, surface-level interactions |
| **Intimate Partners** | Secure-leaning-Anxious | Desires closeness, but "pesado" wound creates anxiety about being "too much" |
| **Kink Contexts** | Most Secure | Permission structure allows authentic attachment needs to emerge without shame |

---

## With Family: Dismissive-Avoidant

### How It Looks

- The Information Firewall = systematic avoidance of emotional vulnerability
- Family knows logistics, not emotional life
- Keeps things light and happy
- Scans mood before speaking
- Strategic information management

### Why It Developed

- Learned early that sharing vulnerability leads to drama/shame (Lipstick Incident)
- Mother's unpredictability made openness unsafe
- Father's unavailability made emotional connection seem impossible
- Universal "pesado" labeling made needs feel pathological

### The Paradox

Ivan would call his mother in a medical emergency (trusts her competence) but wouldn't share the emotional experience (doesn't trust her reception).

## With Intimate Partners: Secure-Leaning-Anxious

### How It Looks

- Comfortable with intimacy
- Desires closeness and connection
- BUT: "pesado" wound creates anxiety about being "too much"
- May not express needs for fear of burdening
- Gives more than asks for in relationships

### The Anxious Edge

> *"Maybe there's doubt about whether those things are enough to make someone want to stay and give me the warmth I need."*

- Uncertainty about whether he deserves care
- Monitoring for signs he's being "too intense"
- May suppress needs preemptively

### What He Wants

> *"Someone who gives warmth, cuddles, sees me, doesn't treat my needs as annoying."*

---

## In Kink Contexts: Most Secure

### How It Looks

- Authentic attachment needs emerge freely
- Can ask for what he wants (as Brahm)
- Vulnerability feels safe
- Receives without needing to earn it

### Why It Works

The permission structure provides:

1. **Explicit safety** - Rules and roles are clear
2. **Named vulnerability** - "Being needy" is allowed, even desired
3. **Physical containment** - Regulated nervous system
4. **Consistent responses** - Predictable dynamics

> *"Brahm isn't allowed to be annoying in daily life. But in kink spaces, Brahm IS allowed to be inchabola and ask for head pats."*

---

## Core Attachment Memory

> *"Crying alone when I was sick and my partner gave me absolutely nothing. That's the image that hurts."*

This is the wound made visible: needing care, being alone, receiving nothing.

## Positive Attachment Experiences

### Childhood (External to Family)

| Figure | What They Provided |
|--------|-------------------|
| "Tía de los cuentos" | Physical affection, emotional attunement, creative activities |
| Dutch grandmother | Warmth, consistent positive regard |
| Strict Asian teachers | Structure, consistency, clear expectations |

**Significance:** Ivan learned what warmth looks like. He knows it exists. The template is there.

### Adult: The Nico/Nyx Breakthrough

> *"Like finding a warm cave for a moment."*

What happened:
- Told "I love you" and "I want you" repeatedly
- Received physical affection freely
- Experienced "happy tears"
- **Proof that secure attachment is accessible to him**

---

## Inner Child Attachment Voice

> *"Give me head pats. Let me cuddle. Is what I did good? Do you like X I did? Let me sit with you and play together."*

This is what secure attachment sounds like for Ivan - the need that wants to emerge.

---

## Attachment Patterns in Relationship Selection

### Potential Pattern

- May select emotionally unavailable partners
- Recreated mother's unpredictability with Laura ("walking on eggshells")
- Partners may not meet emotional needs (or he doesn't communicate them)
- Stayed too long when things weren't working

### The Alexia Insight

She ended it saying she wanted a "deeper connection."

> *"Ironic - that's what I want too. I was probably wearing the mask, being chill, not fully letting her in."*

---

## Integration Goal

> *"I want to be able to ask for care without a permission structure."*

Moving from context-dependent security (only in kink) to integrated security (in daily life as Ivan).
