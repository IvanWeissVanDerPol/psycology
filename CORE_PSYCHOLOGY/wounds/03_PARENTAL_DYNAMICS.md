# Core Wound: Parental Emotional Unavailability

> **Classification:** Attachment Wound  
> **Source:** Both Parents (different patterns)  
> **Present-Day Impact:** HIGH

---

## Overview

The subject's trauma is **not** about physical abandonment - both parents were physically present. The core issue is:

**Emotional inaccessibility and unpredictability WHILE present.**

This created two distinct but interrelated wounds.

# Father: "The Do Not Disturb Sign"

## The Dynamic

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Physical Presence** | Works from home, always around |
| **Emotional Presence** | Perpetually in meetings or monologuing |
| **Conversation Topics** | AI, work, cannabis (his interests only) |
| **Relational Knowledge** | Neither party knows much about the other's "lore" |
| **His Need** | Someone to listen to his monologues |

## Somatic Response to Father

When father "shout-talks" (raised volume, not quite yelling):

- Wants to leave
- Feels like crying
- Gets tense
- Wants to end interaction and remove self

> *"Not fear exactly - more like exhaustion and 'here we go again.'"*

## The Message Internalized

> **"My presence is a distraction. I am tolerated when invisible or useful."**

## Current Relationship

- Contact every 1-3 weeks
- Interactions feel fine
- No stress, no negative energy
- **But also no depth**

## Adult Outcome: The Fixer Pattern

Compulsive over-functioning in relationships to "pay rent" for existence.

# Mother: "The Unpredictable Manager"

## The Dynamic

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Behavior Pattern** | High-variance: competent one moment, highly critical the next |
| **Labels Used** | "Pesado," "inchabola" |
| **Golden Child** | No permanent one - depends on her mood |
| **Reliability** | Unpredictable - never knew which version he'd get |

## The Message Internalized

> **"Information is ammunition. If I share a vulnerability, it might be used to shame me."**

## Current Relationship

- Contact every 1-3 weeks
- Good vibes on surface
- She knows almost none of his "lore"
- Subject keeps things light and happy
- **Scans her mood before speaking**

## Adult Outcome: Hyper-Vigilance

- Learned to read rooms before speaking
- Gives generic "happy" answers to authority figures (including therapists)
- Keeps systems stable at cost of authenticity

---

## Combined Impact: The Dual Wound

### From Father (Unavailability)
→ "I must be useful to deserve attention"  
→ The Fixer Pattern  
→ The Distraction Trigger (being ignored while serving)

### From Mother (Unpredictability)
→ "Information is ammunition"  
→ The Information Firewall  
→ The Unpredictability Trigger (passive-aggression, guessing games)

---

## How This Shows Up in Relationships

### The Laura Pattern (Most Recent Serious Relationship)

> *"She was a bit meaner post-cohabitation, had to adapt the whole house around her mood."*

**Critical Insight from Subject:**

> *"Walking on eggshells, moods I couldn't predict. Probably recreated the same dynamic [as with mother]."*

**Result:** Stayed 7 months past wanting to leave because "I didn't want to feel like the bad guy."

---

## Positive Attachment Figures (Counter-Evidence)

Primary sources of emotional warmth came from **OUTSIDE** the nuclear family:

| Figure | Role |
|--------|------|
| "Tía de los cuentos" | Neighborhood grandmother - nannying, physical affection, creative activities, emotional attunement |
| Dutch grandmother | Warm memories, consistent positive regard |
| Strict Asian lady teachers | Chiang Kai Shek school (ages 7-12) - "liked them a lot" |

**Clinical Significance:** Ivan learned what warmth and care look like. He knows it exists. He just didn't get it from his primary attachment figures.

---

## The Response to Conflict

### When Someone Shouts

> *"I start to cry and tear up. Feel like I'm back home and my dad is shout-talking. I get pissed and want to end the engagement and remove myself."*

### Level-Headed Conflict

Can work through it if approached calmly.

---

## Therapeutic Implications

### Watch For
- Recreating mother's unpredictability in partner selection
- Performing "fine" to keep the therapist (authority figure) comfortable
- Over-functioning to earn the right to exist in the room

### What Helps
- Consistency and predictability from therapeutic relationship
- Direct communication (no guessing games)
- Acknowledgment that doesn't require earning

---

## Integration Goal

> *"I want to learn how to exist in a room without fixing anything and not feel like a burden."*

## Voice Note Evidence (July 2025)

> **Source:** Voice notes from Jonatan chat during breakup processing  
> **Significance:** Ivan directly names the parental origin of his patterns

### Parental Summary - Ivan's Own Words

**PTT-20250729-WA0043.opus** (2025-07-29)
> "**mi vieja nunca me escuchaba, mi viejo es siempre de mandar y escomandar y decir como tiene que ser** tipo no se, en serio siento que el dia de mis tromitas desde que yo saliera de expresarme y sentirme todo asi, que me caga"

Translation: "my mom never listened to me, my dad is always giving orders and commanding and saying how things should be... I seriously feel that the day of my [early years] since I tried to express myself and feel everything, it fucked me up"

**Significance:** Ivan directly connects his communication difficulties to BOTH parents:
- Mother: Never listened
- Father: Always commanded

### "Never Good Enough" - Core Belief Origin

**PTT-20250730-WA0012.opus** (2025-07-30)
> "**sentir mucho que esto de particular es algo malo es más hondo que me hicieron sentir un culo porque no me dieron porra no me hicieron sentir nada fucking ignore** [...] **john [father] su mundo es su pc el super el patio nada mas le importa y en eso nada mas vive** [...] **yo acepte lo que jamas seria good enough** tipo toda mi época de colegio hasta el ipt era porque no sos como tus hermanas"

Translation: "feeling that this particular thing is bad is deeper - they made me feel like shit because they didn't give [me] anything, didn't make me feel anything, fucking ignored [...] John [father] his world is his PC, the supermarket, the yard, nothing else matters to him and that's all he lives in [...] I accepted that I would never be good enough - my whole school era until IPT was 'because you're not like your sisters'"

**Key Elements:**
1. **Father's world** - PC, errands, yard - Ivan doesn't exist in it
2. **Core belief formed** - "I will never be good enough"
3. **Comparison to sisters** - Used as weapon

### The Connection to Current Patterns

These quotes explain WHY Ivan:
- Can't express when something bothers him (mother didn't listen)
- Defaults to service (father only noticed usefulness)
- Expects rejection for having needs (historical evidence)
- Recreates the dynamic with partners (familiar = safe)
