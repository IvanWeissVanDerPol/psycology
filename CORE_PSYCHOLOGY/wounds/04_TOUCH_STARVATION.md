# Core Wound: Touch Starvation

> **Classification:** Attachment/Somatic Wound  
> **Core Memory:** "Crying alone when I was sick and my partner gave me absolutely nothing"  
> **Present-Day Impact:** HIGH

---

## The Wound

Chronic, unmet needs for physical affection throughout development and into adult relationships.

### Core Traumatic Memory

> *"Crying alone when I was sick and my partner gave me absolutely nothing. That's the image that hurts."*

This memory (with Laura, the fistula incident) crystallizes the wound: being vulnerable, in pain, alone, and receiving nothing.

---

## Origin

### Childhood
- No imaginary friends or comfort objects
- Primary affection came from figures outside nuclear family
- Family system focused on logistics, not physical nurturance

### Adult Relationships
- Partners who didn't meet physical affection needs
- Pattern of not communicating these needs (or partners not responding)
- The Laura experience: ultimate proof the wound was real

## Present-Day Manifestations

### What Ivan Craves

| Need | Expression |
|------|------------|
| **Cuddles** | Primary need - being held, wrapped up, physical containment |
| **Head pats** | Specific request from inner child |
| **Being held when sad** | "I want to feel hugs and cuddles when I'm sad" |
| **Warmth** | Physical warmth and body heat |
| **Pressure** | Deep pressure, being wrapped tight |

### The Inner Child Voice

> *"Give me head pats. Let me cuddle. Is what I did good? Do you like X I did? Let me sit with you and play together."*

## The Lonely Wolf Metaphor

When asked for a metaphor of internal state:

> *"A void black wolf, hurt and bleeding with scars, limping in the snow. No other wolves nearby, no tracks, no tracks of prey - just the wolf in the blizzard. The wolf is sad and tired, not angry. Still moving forward, still surviving, but exhausted. It still wants to be found."*

### Key Elements
- **Isolation** - No pack, alone in harsh conditions
- **Wounded** - Carrying scars, bleeding
- **Exhausted** - Not angry, just tired
- **Still hoping** - "It still wants to be found"

---

## The Loneliness Paradox

> *"I can be surrounded by people and still feel cold. This is not something I've accepted as 'just how life is.' I want to change it. I want to be with people I can be closer with. I want to feel hugs and cuddles when I'm sad."*

This is NOT accepted resignation - it's active distress he wants to change.

## The Breakthrough: Nico/Nyx Experience

> *"Like finding a warm cave for a moment."*

What happened:
- Was told "I love you" and "I want you" repeatedly
- Received physical affection freely
- Experienced "happy tears" - genuine emotional breakthrough
- **Proof that receiving care without earning it is possible**

### Historical Counter-Evidence: Lujan (High School)
Ivan's questionnaire response (Jan 2026) revealed an early memory of receiving touch without earning it:
> *"it was nice to just rest our heads together after class while waiting and listening to music and chilling together"*

**Significance:**
- Physical touch (heads resting) without service
- Positive emotional association ("nice")
- Suggests the wound is not absolute—there was a "before" or at least an "exception"

This experience provides therapeutic leverage: he now KNOWS what it feels like to be received.

## What Ivan Wants (His Words)

> *"Someone who gives warmth, cuddles, sees me, doesn't treat my needs as annoying. Someone who appreciates when I cook for them and encourages me to be cute... Someone who will take care of me when I'm sick. Apply the ointments and worry I take my meds. Massage and hug me when I'm in pain. See me cry and respond with love."*

## How Touch Functions for Ivan

### Grounding
- Physical contact pulls him out of spirals
- Breaks the freeze state
- Anchors him to the present moment

### Safety
- Being held = containment = "I've got you"
- Deep pressure = regulated nervous system
- Rope (shibari) = "holds me together when I might otherwise float away"

### Validation
- Touch that says "I'm valued"
- Physical follow-through on verbal reassurance
- Proof that he's not "too much"

---

## Warning Signs (Touch Wound Activated)

| Sign | What's Happening |
|------|------------------|
| Goes quiet | Withdrawing into the wound |
| Puppy-dog eyebrows | Sadness/longing surfacing |
| Fidgeting without task | Seeking regulation through movement |
| Hovering at edges | Wanting closeness but afraid to ask |

---

## What Helps

### Immediate
- Unprompted physical contact
- Being held without having to ask
- Warm, consistent presence

### In Scene/Kink Context
- Aftercare that is primarily physical containment
- Being wrapped up, held firmly
- "Low-stakes existence" - just being together

### Verbal + Physical
- "I've got you"
- "You're not too much"
- "I want you here"
- + Physical follow-through (these words without touch feel hollow)

---

## What Re-Wounds

- Being left alone when vulnerable
- Hollow verbal reassurance without physical follow-through
- Partner on phone during intimate moments
- Receiving care only after earning it through service

---

## The Goal

> *"I want to feel less lonely. I want to feel warm more often."*

Not just occasional warmth in kink contexts, but integration of that warmth into daily life.

## Voice Note Evidence (July-August 2025)

> **Source:** Voice notes from Jonatan chat during breakup processing  
> **Significance:** Ivan's direct expressions of touch needs - rare raw vulnerability

### What Ivan Explicitly Wants

**PTT-20250729-WA0046.opus** (2025-07-29) - CRITICAL
> "**me siento tipo re autista y que no sabe expresar su feeling si le duele todo adentro** y re bueno como computadora y a programación lo que necesites, pero necesito llevar alguien muy a la puta. No sé, en serio, **no es que me importa mi pareja, pero es que el tipo este no más a mi lado cuando me necesito, que si me siento sad, este así para mí me abrace de atrás, me da un malos en la frente y queda calentito**. Y después de que hace eso, que puedo lidiar con pretty much any other thing [...] **No sé, no sé fucking hablar, no sé expresarme. No sé, me pregunto también hace un tiempo como quería que me amen y ni eso fucking sé.**"

This quote is pivotal because Ivan:
1. Acknowledges his competence/usefulness AND his emotional blindness
2. Explicitly describes what he needs: someone beside him, hugged from behind, forehead kiss, warmth
3. States that WITH this, he can handle anything
4. Admits he doesn't even know how he wants to be loved

### Love Languages - Direct Statement

**PTT-20250813-WA0003.opus** (2025-08-13)
> "**flautaco's love languages me estira que no sea tanto de regalos que sea más de physical touch y hacerme confort**, tipo no se, **abrazarme si me está viendo, darme besitos** y eso me estiraría que sea una mina con la que podemos hacer proyectos juntos"

Ivan explicitly identifies his love language: NOT gifts, but physical touch and comfort. Hugs when seen, kisses. This is rare direct self-knowledge.

### The Fistula Incident - What Care Should Look Like

**PTT-20250729-WA0050.opus** (2025-07-29)
> "**si estás bien enfermo... ...what the fuck... ...tipo... ...cuál es el amor de la persona que está enferma, tipo...** [...] **mínimo que esté cerca de mí y darte abrazos y darte calor**"

Ivan articulates the minimum: presence, hugs, warmth. This is what Laura failed to provide.

### The Physical Affection Evidence (Extraction Data)

From the deep extraction analysis:
- **Physical Affection** category: 785 findings across all chats
- **Physical Needs** category: 36 explicit need statements
- **Care Receiving** category: 122 occurrences in Jonatan chat alone

These numbers reflect how central touch/physical connection is to Ivan's psychological landscape.
