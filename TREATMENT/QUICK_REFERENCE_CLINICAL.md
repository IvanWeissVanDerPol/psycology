# QUICK REFERENCE: Clinical Session Guide

> **For:** Therapists during active sessions  
> **Purpose:** At-a-glance reference for effective intervention  
> **Format:** Bullet points, quick tables, immediate actions

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS

**Session Stop Conditions:**
- **"I'm fine" + flat affect** → The Mask is total; Brahm inaccessible
- **Service offers to therapist** → "Let me help you with that scheduling..."
- **Intellectualization loop** → 3+ minutes of analysis without feeling words
- **"I don't know" to emotion questions** → Alexithymia activation

**Immediate Interventions:**
```
"You can be annoying here."
"What would Brahm say?"
"Pause. Just sit with that."
"Your body - what do you notice?"
```

## ✅ WHAT WORKS / ❌ WHAT DOESN'T

| ✅ DO THIS | ❌ AVOID THIS |
|-----------|---------------|
| "You can be intense here" | "It seems like maybe..." (hinting) |
| "I notice The Mask is on" | Accepting "I'm fine" at face value |
| "That's The Fixer speaking" | "Where does this kink come from?" |
| "Brahm can have needs" | Pushing family disclosure |
| Concrete homework assignments | Vague suggestions |
| 3x daily check-ins | Assuming he'll self-notice |

---

## 🎯 SESSION STRUCTURE TEMPLATE

### Opening (5 min)
- **Permission reset:** "Intensity welcome here"
- **State check:** "How's Brahm today?" (not "How are you?")
- **Agenda:** "What's bringing you in?"

### Middle (40 min)
- **Content work:** Primary therapeutic focus
- **Process moments:** Notice defense activation
- **Brahm elicitation:** "What does soft-you need?"

### Closing (5 min)
- **Consolidation:** One insight to carry
- **Homework:** Specific, measurable task
- **Permission carry-forward:** "You can be messy between sessions"

## 🧠 DEFENSE DETECTION GUIDE

| Defense | What It Looks Like | Your Response |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **The Fixer** | Offers help, changes subject to your needs, asks about YOUR day | "I don't need fixing; I'm here for you" |
| **The Mask** | "Chill guy" presentation, humor deflection, "it's all good" | "The Mask is strong. Is Brahm safe?" |
| **The Firewall** | Vague about family, deflects to logistics | "What's behind the firewall right now?" |
| **Intellectualization** | Analysis without feeling, meta-commentary | "Drop the analysis. What's the feeling?" |
| **Permission Seeking** | "Is it okay if...", "Would it be weird..." | "You don't need permission here" |

---

## 🔥 CRISIS PROTOCOL

**If The Mask is total (no Brahm access):**

1. **Assess:** "I notice The Mask is strong today. Is Brahm safe?"
2. **Offer:** "Do you need permission to not be okay?"
3. **Contain:** "We can just sit with this. You don't need to fix it."
4. **Follow-up:** More frequent check-ins until Brahm re-emerges

**Safety Check:**
- Active suicidal ideation? (Not currently reported)
- Self-harm behaviors?
- Substance escalation?
- Social withdrawal complete?

## 📋 COMMON SESSION SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: "I'm Fine" Mask
**Therapist:** "The Mask is saying you're fine. What does Brahm say?"
**Pause:** 10-15 seconds of silence
**Follow-up:** "Permission to not be fine. You can say 'I'm terrible.'"

### Scenario 2: Fixer Activation
**Ivan:** "You know, I could help you set up better scheduling software..."
**Therapist:** "That's The Fixer. I don't need help. What does Ivan need?"
**Redirect:** Back to his experience

### Scenario 3: Intellectualization Loop
**Ivan:** 5-minute analysis of relationship dynamics
**Therapist:** "Pause. Drop the analysis. What's the feeling?"
**Push:** "One word. Sad? Angry? Lonely?"

### Scenario 4: Permission Seeking
**Ivan:** "Would it be weird if I said I need a hug?"
**Therapist:** "You don't need permission here. Try again without the question."
**Model:** "I need a hug." (not a question)

### Scenario 5: Alexithymia Activation
**Ivan:** "I don't know how I feel"
**Therapist:** "Body scan. Shoulders? Chest? Stomach?"
**Prompt:** "Tight? Heavy? Empty? Tingling?"
**Bridge:** "Tight shoulders often mean... what for you?"

   - "uwu" linguistic dependency
   - **Your job:** Explicit permission + gradual reduction

3. **Receiving Without Reciprocation**
   - Immediate urge to return service
   - Blocks deep intimacy
   - **Your job:** Model receiving; don't let him fix you

## 📞 BETWEEN SESSION CONTACT

**Appropriate:**
- Crisis situations
- Homework clarification
- Scheduling

**Not Appropriate:**
- Processing content (save for session)

- Service offers ("Let me help you with...")

**Response Template:**
> "This sounds important. Let's explore it fully in our next session. In the meantime, [specific homework task]."

---

## 🎓 THERAPIST SELF-CARE

**Challenging Aspects:**
- May trigger desire to rescue (The Fixer is compelling)
- Intellectualization can be frustrating
- May feel like you're doing all the noticing work
- Kink content may push comfort zones

**Reminders:**
- His insight accelerates treatment (use it)
- Concrete homework works (use it)
- Permission structures are adaptive (don't pathologize)
- Progress will be non-linear (expect regression)
