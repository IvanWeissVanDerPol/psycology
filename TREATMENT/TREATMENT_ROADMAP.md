## 🎓 THERAPIST NOTES

### What Makes This Treatment Work

1. **High Patient Insight** - Use it; he analyzes himself already
2. **Concrete Homework** - Appeals to Engineer; builds habits
3. **Permission Modeling** - Mirrors successful kink dynamics
4. **Explicit Communication** - No hinting; direct feedback
5. **Both/And Framework** - Engineer AND Brahm, not OR
6. **Strengths-Based** - Kink is resource, not pathology
7. **Pacing Respect** - Don't rush family disclosure

### Common Challenges

1. **Intellectualization** - Gently redirect to feeling
2. **Service to Therapist** - Firm boundary: "I don't need fixing"
3. **Slow Progress** - Non-linear; trust the process
4. **Kink Content** - Stay neutral; it's adaptive
5. **Hopelessness Moments** - "I'll always be like this" - normalize

### Success Predictors

**Good Prognosis Indicators:**
- Homework completion
- Self-reflection in journals
- Attempts at vulnerability
- Brahm emergence in session
- Relationship with Alex as template

**Concern Indicators:**
- Chronic homework non-completion
- Total Mask for multiple sessions
- Service compulsions toward therapist
