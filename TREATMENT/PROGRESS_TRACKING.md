> **Purpose:** Quantifiable progress monitoring across treatment phases  
> **Method:** Baseline → Target → Tracking → Review

## 📊 PRIMARY OUTCOME METRICS

### 1. Self-Notice Capacity (Alexithymia Reduction)

**Definition:** Ability to identify and name internal emotional states without external prompting.

**Baseline (Pre-Treatment):**
- Quote: *"I don't notice when I am bad"*
- Requires external noticing: "You seem off"
- Difficulty answering "How are you feeling?"

**Measurement Method:**
```
Weekly Self-Report:
"This week, I could identify my emotions:"
[ ] Yes, most of the time (3+ times/day)
[ ] Sometimes (1-2 times/day)
[ ] Rarely (few times total)
[ ] No, I still don't know what I'm feeling

Body Awareness Check:
"When I scan my body, I notice:"
[ ] Clear sensations (tight, heavy, empty, etc.)
[ ] Vague sensations
[ ] Nothing / numb
[ ] I don't remember to scan
```

**Phase Targets:**

| Phase | Target | Success Criteria |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)** | Basic awareness | Identifies 1+ emotion/day |
| **Phase 2 (Months 4-9)** | Regular awareness | Identifies 3+ emotions/day |
| **Phase 3 (Months 10-18)** | Automatic awareness | Identifies emotions without deliberate effort |

**Success Metric:** 
- Baseline: 0-1 emotions identified/day (external dependent)
- 6-Month Target: 3+ emotions identified/day (self-generated)
- 12-Month Target: Automatic identification

---

### 2. Permission Structure Dependency

**Definition:** Need for explicit external validation to access vulnerability/needs.

**Baseline (Pre-Treatment):**
- "uwu" language pervasive in intimate communication
- "Can I has cuddles?" (not "Can I have cuddles?")
- "Would it be weird if...?" questions
- Cannot access Brahm without scaffolding

**Measurement Method:**
```
Weekly Text Analysis (Intimate Partners Only):
Count of "uwu" indicators:
- Baby talk: "has" vs "have", "dat" vs "that"
- Softening phrases: "Is it okay...", "Would it be weird..."
- Permission questions: "Can I...", "May I..."
- Apologetic framing: "Sorry but...", "I know this is weird..."

Weekly Self-Report:
"I needed permission to express needs:"
[ ] Always (every time)
[ ] Often (most of the time)
[ ] Sometimes (about half)
[ ] Rarely (few times)
[ ] Never (gave myself permission)
```

**Phase Targets:**

| Phase | Target | Success Criteria |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Awareness | Tracks "uwu" usage, notices when it appears |
| **Phase 2** | Reduction | 50% reduction in "uwu" usage |
| **Phase 3** | Autonomy | <10% "uwu" usage OR conscious choice (not compulsion) |

**Success Metric:**
- Baseline: High "uwu" usage (estimated 80%+ of vulnerable communications)
- 6-Month Target: Reduced by 50% (40% usage)
- 12-Month Target: <10% or intentional (not automatic)

---

### 3. Receiving Capacity

**Definition:** Ability to accept care without immediate reciprocation or discomfort.

**Baseline (Pre-Treatment):**
- Immediate urge to return service when receiving care
- "Am I making them uncomfortable?"
- Can only receive in kink/permission contexts
- Blocks deep intimacy; keeps relationships transactional

**Measurement Method:**
```
Weekly Receiving Log:
"This week, someone offered me care/support/affection:"
[ ] 0 times
[ ] 1-2 times
[ ] 3-5 times
[ ] 6+ times

"When I received care:"
[ ] I immediately offered to reciprocate (Fixer activated)
[ ] I felt uncomfortable but accepted
[ ] I accepted without immediate urge to reciprocate
[ ] I fully received and felt grateful (no reciprocation urge)

Discomfort Scale (1-10):
"How uncomfortable was receiving? ___/10"

Delay Time:
"How long until reciprocation urge? ___ minutes"
```

**Phase Targets:**

| Phase | Target | Success Criteria |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Awareness | Notices reciprocation urge |
| **Phase 1** | Delay | 30-second delay possible in session |
| **Phase 2** | Tolerance | Accepts 3+ favors/week without reciprocation |
| **Phase 3** | Integration | Comfortable receiving without reciprocation (discomfort <3/10) |

**Success Metric:**
- Baseline: Immediate reciprocation urge (0-5 second delay)
- 3-Month Target: 30-second delay (session practice)
- 6-Month Target: Accepts 3+ favors/week without reciprocation
- 12-Month Target: Comfortable receiving (discomfort <3/10)

---

### 4. Loneliness (Temporal Variability)

**Definition:** Subjective sense of isolation with addiction-like pattern to external validation.

**Baseline (Pre-Treatment):**
- Quote: *"5/10 loneliness depending on when I got warmth last"*
- Warmth binge/crash cycles
- External validation dependency

**Measurement Method:**
```
Daily Loneliness Scale:
"Today my loneliness was: ___/10"

Weekly Pattern Review:
"My loneliness varied based on:"
- Last contact with partner: ___ hours ago
- Physical affection received: ___
- Quality of interactions: ___/10

Loneliness Independence:
"Even without external contact, I can:"
[ ] Self-soothe effectively
[ ] Distract myself
[ ] Feel okay for short periods
[ ] Feel terrible until next contact
```

**Phase Targets:**

| Phase | Target | Success Criteria |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Awareness | Tracks loneliness patterns |
| **Phase 2** | Moderation | Reduced variance (fewer crashes) |
| **Phase 3** | Self-Sustainability | Self-generated warmth reduces dependency |

**Success Metric:**

Fixer Urge Frequency:
"I felt the urge to fix/help when not asked:"

```

**Phase Targets:**

Success: All 5 are positive definitions (not oppositional)
```

## 🚨 REGRESSION INDICATORS

**Watch For (Immediate Intervention):**

1. **Self-notice regression:** "I don't know what I'm feeling" returns
2. **Permission surge:** "uwu" usage increases significantly
3. **Receiving collapse:** Cannot accept any care without reciprocation
4. **Fixer burnout:** Exhaustion, resentment, service compulsion extreme
5. **Total Mask:** "I'm fine" + withdrawal for multiple sessions
6. **Loneliness spike:** 8+/10 sustained
7. **Relationship rupture:** Multiple conflicts or withdrawals
8. **Disengagement:** Missed sessions, homework non-completion

**Response Protocol:**
1. Assess trigger (what happened?)
2. Return to Phase 1 basics (permission, self-notice)
3. Increase session frequency if needed
4. Normalize: "Regression is part of change"
5. Rebuild from last stable point
