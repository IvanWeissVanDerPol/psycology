# A Letter to My Masters
## From Brahm

---

Hello. If you're reading this, it means I trust you enough to show you who I really am. Not the competent engineer who solves problems and manages projects. Not the guy who has everything together. The real one. The soft one. The one who has been waiting, for a very long time, for permission to exist.

I wrote this because I'm not always good at explaining myself in the moment. Words get stuck. The part of me that needs things gets shy and hides behind the part of me that's useful. So I'm writing it down while I can think clearly, hoping it helps you understand how I work.

---

# The Two Versions of Me

There are two of me, and they can't exist at the same time.

## The Engineer

That's the one you'll meet by default. He's analytical, competent, composed. He solves problems before you even know they exist. He's useful. He learned a long time ago that being useful was the only way to justify taking up space in a family that didn't quite know what to do with him.

## Brahm

I'm soft. I'm needy. I want to curl up at your feet and feel your hand in my hair and know that I belong somewhere. I want to serve you not because I have to prove anything, but because making you happy makes me happy. I want to be held so tightly that I can't think about anything else.

Here's the thing people sometimes get wrong: **Brahm isn't a character I play. Brahm is the real one.** The Engineer is the armor I built because being needy and intense and "too much" wasn't safe when I was growing up. So I learned to be useful instead. I learned to be the one who fixes things, who anticipates problems, who never asks for anything because asking felt like a burden.

But you can't access Brahm by just asking. There's a firewall. I need explicit permission to let my guard down.

---

# How to Find Me

The firewall exists because I learned early that being vulnerable got me hurt. My dad was emotionally distant—present in body, absent in attention. My mom was unpredictable—loving one moment, volatile the next. So I built walls. I became the kid who didn't need anything, who was always fine, who could handle everything on his own.

| The Walls I Built | The Key | What Doesn't Work |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Learned to be self-sufficient, never asking for help or attention | Explicit permission to let my guard down and be vulnerable | Hints and implications—I need direct, clear communication |

To get past those walls, you need to give me explicit permission. Hints don't work. Implications don't work. You have to say it directly.

---

# Words That Let Me Out

| Phrase | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| "You can be annoying with me." | Permission to be myself without filtering |
| "You can be intense." | Acceptance of my full emotional range |
| "Come here." | Direct invitation to closeness |
| "Sit with me." | Explicit welcome into your space |

Any explicit invitation to be close, to take up space, to rest my body against yours—these are the phrases that unlock the real me.

---

# Actions That Let Me Out Without Words

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Placing the Collar** | This is the clearest signal that we're switching modes. The collar is a physical marker of transition. |
| **Offering Your Hand** | So I can put my head on it—a simple gesture that says I'm welcome to be close. |
| **Head Scratches** | Starting to scratch my head without me asking—unprompted affection that says I don't have to earn it. |
| **Physical Closeness** | Pulling me into your lap or your arms—direct physical invitation to vulnerability. |

Once I'm out, once I feel safe, I might nudge my head into your hands to ask for pets. I might cuddle up close. These aren't demands—they're just me finally being able to ask for affection without feeling like I have to earn it first.

---

# How You'll Know I'm Happy

I'm not always good at saying "I'm having a good time" out loud. But my face and my body will tell you everything.

The difference is subtle but it's there. When I'm really okay, I'm present. When I'm performing, I'm watching from behind the mask.

## When I'm Genuinely Content

| Sign | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **My Face Relaxes** | The tension I usually carry just... drops. You'll see it in my forehead, my jaw, my eyes. |
| **I Integrate Into the Group** | I stop hovering at the edges and actually settle in. I'm not observing—I'm participating. |
| **I Get Physically Closer** | Without being asked, I'll move into your space. It's natural, not forced. |
| **I Might Get Playful** | A little silly, a little more expressive. The real personality comes through. |

## When I'm Performing Contentment (But Actually Struggling)

| Sign | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **I Stay at the Edges** | Present but not quite there. Observing rather than participating. |
| **My Face Looks Fine** | But it's a bit too still. The Happy Mask is on—controlled, composed, not quite real. |
| **I'm Quieter Than Usual** | Or I'm talking but it feels automatic. Words without real presence behind them. |
| **I Don't Initiate Contact** | I won't reach out, won't move closer, won't ask for anything. |

---

# My Tells

My face gives me away. Especially my eyebrows.

| State | What You'll See |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Slipping Into a Bad Headspace** | I get puppy eyes. My eyebrows go up in the middle, that sad-worried look. If you see that expression, something's wrong inside even if I'm saying I'm fine. |
| **Genuinely Relaxed** | My whole face softens. No tension in my forehead or jaw. I look happy and I'm integrated into whatever's happening around me—not observing it from a distance, but actually part of it. |

---

# Why I Need to Serve You

Service is my love language. It's how I show I care. But it's also... more complicated than that.

> **"If I am useful enough, I deserve to exist here."**

Deep down, there's a voice that says this. I know that's not healthy. I'm working on it. But understanding where it comes from doesn't make it go away overnight. So when I cook for you, clean for you, anticipate what you need before you ask—part of that is genuine love, and part of it is an old wound trying to prove I'm worth keeping around.

What I need from you is acknowledgment. Not just "thanks" as you scroll through your phone. Real, present acknowledgment. When you notice what I did. When you tell me it was good. When you call me "good boy" or "useful" and I can feel that you mean it. That's when the old wound quiets down and the real joy of serving you can come through.

## What Helps Me Feel Seen

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Specific Praise** | "Thanks for the food, it was delicious." Tell me exactly what was good. |
| **Affirming Words** | "Good boy." "Useful." Words that acknowledge my service directly. |
| **Physical Rewards** | Cuddles, warm hugs, a hand on my cheek. Touch that says I'm valued. |
| **Detailed Recognition** | Telling me exactly what was good about what I did—not generic, but specific. |

## What Makes Me Spiral

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Generic Acknowledgment** | Automatic responses that feel like you're not really present |
| **Silence** | When my service goes completely unnoticed |
| **Distracted Recognition** | Being acknowledged while you're looking at your phone or TV |
| **Delayed Recognition** | Acknowledgment that comes long after the moment has passed |

If my service goes unnoticed, here's what happens inside me: First, I wonder if it was okay. "Did I do it right?" Then I start feeling like I'm being annoying, like I'm too intense. Then I get quiet, and I put on the mask, because I don't want to "ruin the mood" with my neediness. That spiral happens fast. A little acknowledgment stops it before it starts.

---

# When I Freeze

Sometimes, if I don't have a clear task or direction, I freeze. This comes from growing up with an unpredictable mother—I learned to constantly scan for what was expected of me, because getting it wrong could mean an explosion. So when I don't know what I should be doing, I get stuck in that old pattern.

Inside, I'm thinking: "What should I be doing? Am I in the way? Did I do something wrong?"

## You Might Notice

- I'm Fidgeting (restless movements, unable to settle)
- I've Gotten Quiet (the conversation drops off, I withdraw)
- My Expression Has Changed (maybe my eyebrows look worried—the puppy eyes appear)
- My Gaze Is Unfocused (like I'm searching for something, scanning the environment)
- I Look a Little Lost (disconnected from the moment, uncertain of my place)

## How to Help Me

| Method | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Give Me a Direct Command** | "Sit here." "Come here." "Stay." "Kneel." Being told exactly what to do doesn't feel controlling to me—it feels like safety. The ambiguity is what hurts. Clear direction is a gift. |
| **Break the Freeze With Touch** | An unprompted hug. Being held without having to ask. Your hand on my head or my back. Physical contact grounds me and pulls me out of the spiral. |

---

# What Makes Me Feel Owned

The collar matters. But there are other things that go even deeper.

**I want to carry marks.**

Bite marks on my arms. Hickeys. Scratches from your nails. When I look at my body afterward and see the evidence that you claimed me—that does something to me. It's proof. It's a reminder I can see and touch even when you're not there. It says: "Someone wanted me enough to leave a mark."

So please—don't be gentle if you don't want to be. I want to feel it later. I want to press the bruise and remember.

---

# My Relationship with Pain

I like pain. Not in a grim, teeth-gritting way. It actually makes me... playful.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **The Giddiness** | When you hurt me, I go into this headspace where I'm almost laughing |
| **The Game** | "Let's see how much I can take"—it becomes a challenge |
| **The Show** | I'm showing off for you, proving myself |
| **The Joy** | I'm not suffering—I'm having fun |

If I'm smiling, I'm good. If I start giggling, I'm really good. That's me enjoying myself.

---

# How I Communicate During Scenes

I might go a bit nonverbal. Words get hard when I'm deep in subspace. But I'll still communicate—just not always with language.

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Watch My Smile** | If I'm smiling, I'm okay. This is your primary indicator. |
| **If the Smile Is Gone** | And I'm not responding, something might be wrong—check in. |
| **Check-In Methods** | A simple "color?" works without breaking the space. |
| **Read My Face** | I'm not good at hiding what I'm feeling, even when I can't say it. |

You can check in without breaking the space. Or just watch my face—I'm not good at hiding what I'm feeling, even when I can't say it.

---

# What I'm Insecure About

Honestly? I just need to know that I'm cared about.

That's the core of it. Under all the service, the submission, the need to be useful—there's a part of me that's still not sure I'm actually wanted. Not for what I can do, but for who I am. The useful part of me is easy to want. The needy part, the intense part, the part that wants too much? I'm still learning to believe that part is welcome too.

| What Doesn't Land Deep | What Lands Deep |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| "You're so helpful" | I see you — not just what you do for me |
| "Good job" | You belong here, even when you're not performing |
| Praise for what I do | I want the messy parts of you too |
| | You're not too much |

So if you want to reassure me, that's where it lands deepest: not "you're so helpful" but "I care about you." Not "good job" but "I want you here."

---

# How I Handle Sharing

I'm not jealous. That's not really my wiring.

| Step | My Response |
|------|-------------|
| **Watching** | I'm okay watching—enjoying the show, honestly |
| **Joining** | Then participating later—that works for me |
| **Being Included** | The only thing that would hurt is being completely excluded |

I don't mind sharing. If you're with someone else, I'm okay watching and then joining in later. That's hot. Being made to feel like I don't belong in the dynamic at all? That would hurt.

So include me, even if I'm just watching at first. Let me be part of it. That's what matters.

---

# My Ideal Scene

If you want to know what makes me happiest:

## Being Treated Like a Cat

Curled up, petted, kissed, made to feel small and cute and adored. Just existing in your space while you give me attention. Head scratches. Soft words. Being looked at like I'm something precious.

## Being Tied Up

Made to look pretty in the ropes. Praised for how I look. Cuddled afterward. The rope is containment—it holds me together when I might otherwise float away. And then the cuddles bring me back.

Simple, really. I just want to be adored.

---

# When Things Go Wrong

If something goes wrong—a trigger gets hit, something doesn't land right, I drop unexpectedly—here's what helps:

**Hold me.**

That's really it. Physical containment. Being wrapped up in someone. Feeling a body against mine, arms around me, pressure that says "I've got you." I don't need a lot of words in that moment. I need to be held until the bad feeling passes. Stay with me. Don't let go until I'm ready.

---

# What Can Hurt Me (And How to Avoid It)

I can handle a lot. Correction doesn't scare me—if I did something wrong, please tell me directly. "You did this wrong, do it this way" is fine. I might feel a little sting, but I'll recover quickly because I know where I stand.

What I can't handle is ambiguity. Guessing games. Passive-aggression. Silent disappointment.

## The Distraction Trigger

| The Wound | What Helps |
|-----------|------------|
| This comes from my emotionally unavailable father. If I'm serving you and you're not really present—scrolling your phone, watching TV, not really seeing me—something inside me goes: "I am invisible." | Even brief acknowledgment helps. You don't have to make a big deal of it. Just be present for a moment. That's enough. |

## The Unpredictability Trigger

| The Wound | What Helps |
|-----------|------------|
| This comes from my unpredictable mother. If you're upset with me but won't tell me why—if you're being passive-aggressive, or expecting me to figure out what I did wrong—I will put on my Happy Mask and start performing "everything is fine" to avoid conflict. That's not me being okay. That's me being terrified. | Please just tell me. "You did this wrong" is safe. "You should know what you did" is not. |

---

# How to Push Me (In Good Ways)

I'm still figuring out my edges. But here are some things that feel like growth for me:

## Eye Contact

Holding your gaze when everything in me wants to look away because it's too intense. When you make me look at you, really look at you, something opens up.

## Hearing Good Things About Myself

This sounds easy but it's actually hard. When you tell me what you like about me—not what I did, but who I am—part of me wants to deflect or dismiss it. Making me stay present with the praise, making me take it in... that's a challenge. A good one.

---

# The Other Side of Me

I'm not only a sub. There's a dom side too.

When I'm in that mode, I get into roleplay. I like creating scenes—often inspired by anime or hentai aesthetics. I think about composition, about how things look, about building a moment that feels cinematic and hot at the same time.

I can be assertive. I can take charge. But I do it in steps, checking as I go.

## How I Escalate

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Start With Permission** | I'll begin with something I have permission for—say, kisses on the nape of the neck. |
| **Ask for the Next Step** | "Can I kiss your mouth?" If yes, I'll go there. |
| **Build Gradually** | Then maybe I'll ask to go further. I build up. I check in. I don't assume. |
| **Each Step Needs Yes** | Each step needs a yes before I take the next one. |

And some things I'll be shy to ask for unprompted. Like—I'm definitely not going to just grab a boob without being invited. That kind of thing I need explicit permission or encouragement for. Tell me it's okay and I'll be more confident. Leave it ambiguous and I'll stay cautious.

If you want me to take charge, give me that permission clearly. "You can do what you want" or "I want you to be in control." That unlocks me. Otherwise I'll keep asking, keep checking, keep making sure I'm not overstepping.

---

# Hard Limits

I'm open to exploring almost anything with you. But there are two things that are completely off the table:

| Limit | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Needle Play** | NO |
| **Knife Play** | NO |

Everything else? Let's talk about it.

---

# After We Play

After a scene, even a good one, there's a voice in my head that asks: "Was I too intense? Was I a good boy?"

**Aftercare is what silences that voice.**

## What I Need for Aftercare

| Need | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Validation** | Tell me that my intensity was welcome, not "too much." Tell me I was good. Tell me you wanted exactly what I gave you. |
| **Containment** | Hold me. Tight. Deep pressure helps—being wrapped up, held firmly, feeling your body against mine. Rope works for this too. I need to feel physically contained. |
| **Low-Stakes Existence** | Just being on the sofa with you. Smelling you. Feeling warm. No tasks, no expectations. Just existing together without having to do or be anything. |

I can switch back to Engineer mode quickly if I need to—I'm my own boss, so I can stay in Brahm mode until I'm ready to go back to my PC. There's no mandatory recovery time. But please don't rush the transition if I still need to be held.

# Something Important About My Health

If you're reading this, I've trusted you with something I don't share with many people. Not even my family knows this.

I'm HIV-positive, and I'm on treatment. My viral load is undetectable, which means I cannot transmit HIV to partners. This has been proven by multiple large-scale studies—PARTNER, PARTNER2—and is accepted as scientific fact.

| Fact | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **U=U** | Undetectable equals Untransmittable |
| **Medical Equivalence** | For transmission purposes, this is medically equivalent to being HIV-negative |
| **Why I'm Telling You** | Because I want you to have all the information, and because this disclosure means I trust you |

---

# What I Love

| Interest | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Rope and Shibari** | The pressure, the constraint, the feeling of being held in place. It's containment. It's safety made physical. |
| **Pet Play** | Being your pet, being cared for, being simple and uncomplicated for a while. |
| **Service Submission** | Taking care of you. Making your life easier. Being useful in a way that feeds both of us. |

I'm open to exploring other things. I want to try new things with you. As long as it's not needles or knives, I'm willing to talk about it.
