## Submissive Side (Primary)

### Core Dynamic

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Primary Expression** | Service-oriented - "the maid function" |
| **What He Responds To** | Warmth, physical containment, explicit reassurance |
| **What He Needs** | Specific acknowledgment ("that was good" over generic "thanks") |
| **Vulnerable To** | Being ignored, cold energy, feeling like burden |
| **Favorite Dynamic** | Cat/neko - wants to be petted, adored, treated like precious |

### What Works Physically

| Sensation | Why It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tightness and rope bite (shibari) | Containment, feeling held |
| Breath on neck | Intimate, present attention |
| The look in their eyes | Being seen |
| Specific, physical praise | Acknowledgment that lands |
| Warmth, pressure, being held | Nervous system regulation |
| Being looked at "like something precious" | Counters "pesado" wound |

### Relationship with Pain

> *"Laughing, let's see how much I can handle."*

- Playful challenge, not emotional catharsis
- Makes him giddy, almost laughing
- "The Game" - showing off, proving himself
- Wants to see marks for the whole week

## What Makes Him Feel Owned/Claimed

| Element | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| **Collar** | Activates submissive space, transition marker |
| **Physical marks** | Bites, hickeys, scratches - "Someone wanted me enough to leave a mark" |
| **Body writing** | Visible claiming |
| **Being made to look cute in ropes** | Aesthetic + containment |

> *"I want to carry marks. I want to press the bruise and remember."*

---

## Specific Interests (Confirmed)

| Interest | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Shibari/rope bondage | Containment, looking pretty |
| Pet play | Cat/neko dynamic |
| Service submission | Maid aesthetic |
| Pegging | Openly enjoys, no shame |
| Praise kink | "Good boy" |
| Collar/collaring | Transition marker |
| Impact play, biting, marking | Wants lasting marks |
| Breath play/choking | Yes |
| CNC | Consensual non-consent |
| Exhibitionism | Yes |
| Orgasm control | Yes |
| Role play | Anime-inspired, maid, pet/owner, servant/royalty |

---

## Dominant Side

### When It Emerges

> *"I'm so sub that if you need a Dom, I will Dom you."*

- Creates anime/hentai-inspired scenes
- Thinks about composition, how things look
- Builds cinematic moments

### How He Escalates

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Start with something permitted (kisses on neck) |
| 2 | Ask for next step ("Can I kiss your mouth?") |
| 3 | Build gradually, check in |
| 4 | Each step needs yes before proceeding |

### What He Needs as Dom

- Explicit permission to take charge
- "You can do what you want" unlocks him
- Will stay cautious without clear permission
- Also needs aftercare - cuddles, warmth, reassurance
- Growth edge: being "mean" in ways partner wants

---

## Hard Limits

| Limit | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Needle Play** | ABSOLUTE NO |
| **Knife Play** | ABSOLUTE NO |
| Everything else | Open to discussion |

---

## Communication During Scenes

### Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Smiling** | I'm okay, keep going |
| **Face relaxed** | Genuinely content |
| **Puppy-dog eyebrows** | Something's wrong (even if saying fine) |
| **Fidgety/quiet without task** | May be freezing |
| **Smile gone + not responding** | Check in immediately |

### Check-In Methods

- **Squeeze hand:** Relaxed squeeze back = fine; fast/anxious = not okay
- **"Color?"** - Works without breaking space
- **Watch face** - Not good at hiding feelings

### May Go Slightly Nonverbal

Words get hard in deep subspace. Will still communicate through body and face.

## Triggers in Scenes

| Trigger | Origin |
|---------|--------|
| Being called "annoying" without clear affection | Pesado wound |
| Being ignored while serving | Father wound |
| Cold/distant energy | Touch starvation |
| Feeling like burden | Core wound |
| Genuine anger | Father's shout-talking |
| Being compared negatively | Pesado wound |
| Feeling excluded | Loneliness wound |

---

## Recovery Protocol (If Triggered)

**Immediate:**
1. Stop scene (or continue gently if impact helps)
2. Physical containment - hold him
3. Warmth, pressure, wrapped up
4. Simple reassurance:
   - "I've got you"
   - "You're not too much"
   - "I want you here"

**Sequence:** Physical safety first, talk later when grounded.

> *"I don't need a lot of words in that moment. I need to be held until the bad feeling passes."*

---

## Aftercare Needs

### What He Needs

| Need | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Being held** | PRIMARY - physical containment |
| **Warmth** | Blankets, body heat, couch |
| **Validation** | "Your intensity was welcome" / "You were good" |
| **Low-stakes existence** | Just being, not performing |
| **Reassurance** | That he's not a burden |
| **Time** | Could stay for hours in aftercare mode |

### What NOT To Do

- Leave alone
- Be on phone
- Give hollow reassurance without physical follow-through
- Rush the transition back to "normal"

---

## Ideal Scenes

### Being Treated Like a Cat

> *"Curled up, petted, kissed, made to feel small and cute and adored. Just existing in your space while you give me attention. Head scratches. Soft words. Being looked at like I'm something precious."*

### Being Tied Up

> *"Made to look pretty in the ropes. Praised for how I look. Cuddled afterward. The rope is containment—it holds me together when I might otherwise float away. And then the cuddles bring me back."*

---

## Sharing/Poly

- Not jealous by wiring
- Okay watching, then joining
- **What would hurt:** Being completely excluded from the dynamic
- "Include me, even if I'm just watching at first. Let me be part of it."
