### Alexia Bogarin - "The One That Got Away"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **What Drew Him** | "Zelda vibes" - internet girl energy |
| **Connection** | Intellectual compatibility, shared activities (music, video games) |
| **Feeling** | "Felt seen by her" |
| **How It Ended** | She ended it, saying she wanted a "deeper connection" |

**Subject's Insight:**

> *"Ironic - that's what I want too. I was probably wearing the mask, being chill, not fully letting her in."*

**Pattern Identified:** The mask prevented authentic connection, even when he wanted depth.

### Laura (~1 year) - Most Recent Serious

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **How They Met** | Kink party |
| **Connection Point** | Femdom, pegging, sounding interests; intellectual like Alexia |
| **Cohabitation** | She moved in after ~5 months (her family drama) |

**Post-Cohabitation:**

> *"She was a bit meaner, had to adapt the whole house around her mood."*

**Critical Pattern Identified:**

> *"Walking on eggshells, moods I couldn't predict. Probably recreated the same dynamic [as with mother]."*

**How Long He Stayed:** 7 months past wanting to leave

**Why:**
- "Didn't want to feel like the bad guy"
- Her mother was hospitalized
- Pattern of staying too long

**Breaking Point:** The fistula incident - crying alone while sick and she gave nothing.

> *"That's the image that hurts."*

## Patterns Across Relationships

### Relationship Initiation

> *"Friend of a friend visits, cuddling, get horny, get romantic."*

- More passive/receptive in initiation
- Often starts casually, develops into more

### Selection Pattern

- May select emotionally unavailable partners
- Intellectual connection important
- Possible recreation of mother's unpredictability

### Communication Issues

- Partners may not meet emotional needs
- Subject doesn't communicate needs clearly
- Only tells partners about hurt if too painful to ignore
- Assumes partners should "just know" when visibly upset

### Service Pattern

- Service is primary expression across all relationships
- "The Fixer" operates in romantic contexts
- Gives more than asks for

### Staying Too Long

- Pattern of remaining in relationships past the expiration point
- Doesn't want to be "the bad guy"
- External circumstances used as reasons to stay

### Protective Mechanisms

- Can "kill feelings" deliberately
- Mask prevents full intimacy
- Need for partners to be self-sufficient (low demands)

## What Ivan Wants in a Partner

> *"Someone who gives warmth, cuddles, sees me, doesn't treat my needs as annoying. Someone who appreciates when I cook for them and encourages me to be cute. Someone I can talk about technical things with, experiment with new things, chill together, play games we both like. Waking up together, making breakfast, working on our own things during the day, cooking dinner together, playing games or watching series, cuddling on the couch, skin care nights, going to bed together. Someone who will take care of me when I'm sick. Apply the ointments and worry I take my meds. Massage and hug me when I'm in pain. See me cry and respond with love."*

## Long-Term Vision (Age 40-50)

Found family/chosen family household with primary partner, "adopting" kinky adults to share life with - people who care for each other.
