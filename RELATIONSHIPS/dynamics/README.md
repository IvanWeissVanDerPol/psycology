## Key Patterns Across All Profiles

### 1. The Fixer is Universal BUT Can Be Healthy
- Appears in romantic, sexual, platonic, male, and female relationships
- Primary relationship currency = SERVICE
- Ranges from depleting (Laura, Magali) to sustainable (Ara, Defi, Nico, Mike)
- **NEW FINDING:** With explicit reciprocity, The Fixer becomes sustainable
- Evidence: Nico gives recognition + touch, Mike gives massage → Ivan doesn't deplete

### 2. The "uwu" Permission Structure
- Linguistic marker for vulnerability
- Required even when asking for help (Cookie chat)
- Functions as "soft Ivan" signal

### 3. "Pesado" Prevention
- Apologizing for presence before it's questioned
- "Sorry if I'm too random"
- Hedging all requests

### 4. Sexual > Emotional Fluency
- Can discuss explicit kink openly
- Cannot say "I need care" directly
- The Fistula Incident proves the gap

### 5. Balance IS Possible
- Ara, Defi, Cookie show healthier patterns exist
- Tend to be lower emotional intensity
- Clear boundaries, mutual respect
