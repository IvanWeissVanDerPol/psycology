## Section K: Work and Identity

### K1. Professional Self

**Draft Answer (Based on Voice Note Analysis):**
> "I genuinely believe I'm way above every other guy... Full service maid butler with main character syndrome."
>
> **Option A (The Safe Zone):** Work is my safe zone. It's where the rules are clear: Input effort -> Output value -> Receive validation. The Engineer runs the show here. I solve problems before others even know they exist. If I'm useful, I'm safe.
>
> **Option B (The Superiority Defense):** It's not just about safety; it's about proving I'm *better*. "Main character syndrome." I work hard to prove that I am indispensable. If I am the most competent person in the room, nobody can call me 'pesado'. I weaponize competence to silence my critics (internal and external).
>
> **Option C (The Burden of Competence):** Sometimes I hate being the one who fixes everything. It's exhausting. But I don't know who I am if I'm not "The Guy Who Knows Tech."

1. You co-founded an AI consultancy startup with your sister Kyrian. How does The Engineer show up at work?
   **Draft Answer:** He shows up as the hyper-competent problem solver. He anticipates bottlenecks. He automates the boring stuff. He ensures nothing breaks so nobody has a reason to be mad.

2. Does work feel like another arena where you need to earn your place?
   **Option A:** Yes. Every day is a new interview. I have to re-earn my value constantly.
   **Option B:** No, work is the ONE place I feel secure because I *know* I'm good at it. It's relationships that feel precarious.

3. What's your relationship with your work identity vs. your emotional identity?
   **Draft Answer:** They are completely separate. Work Ivan (Engineer) is efficient, loud, confident. Emotional Ivan (Brahm) is quiet, needy, hidden. I don't let them meet because I'm afraid Engineer Ivan would judge Brahm for being "useless."

4. **Identity Contrast - Ivan vs. "Typical Paraguayan Man"**

   **Ivan's Self-Description:**
   > "Heteros in Paraguay are horrible. No hygiene, no care, no cuddles, no respect, no communication, lots of lies and bad vibes. Don't cook, don't clean, don't do anything more than drinking and sports and wasting time.
   >
   > I do the opposite of all of this. I am told I am handsome. I come from middle upper class (I don't care about money, I use it for making people around me nice and to share things)."

   **Analysis:**
   - **Hygiene & Care:** Explicitly values cleanliness, nurturing, physical affection
   - **Domestic Competence:** Cooks, cleans, manages household (complete opposite of stereotype)
   - **Communication:** Values respectful, honest communication
   - **Money Philosophy:** Middle-upper class background but uses money for service/sharing, not status
   - **Physical Identity:** "Handsome" - positive self-image regarding appearance
   - **The Contrast as Identity:** Being "not like other guys" is central to self-concept

   **Clinical Note:** This contrast serves multiple functions:
   1. Justifies The Fixer behavior ("I actually help unlike other men")
   2. Explains service-giving ("I'm different/better")
   3. Reinforces self-worth through comparison
   4. May create pressure to maintain "perfect partner" image

### K2. AI Interest

**Draft Answer (Based on Jan 2026 Voice Notes):**
> "hacer un documento con antigravity..."
>
> **Option A (The Bridge):** I use AI because it bridges the gap between my brain (System A) and my heart (System B). I have the 'autism of not knowing how to express myself', but I speak Tech fluently. AI translates my pain into code I can debug.
>
> **Option B (The Safe Listener):** AI doesn't judge. AI doesn't get tired. AI doesn't think I'm 'pesado' if I send 50 voice notes. It's the ultimate safe container. It allows me to be "too much" without consequences.
>
> **Option C (The Solution):** I see life as a system to be optimized. If I'm unhappy, it's a bug. AI helps me find the root cause and patch it. It's not just therapy; it's debugging my source code.

1. What drew you to use AI for this self-analysis?
   [Select or combine options]

2. Is there something about AI (non-judgmental, always available, doesn't have needs) that makes vulnerability easier?
   **Draft Answer:** 100%. The "pesado" wound doesn't trigger with AI because AI has infinite patience. I can finally speak without watching for the other person's "annoyed face."

3. What's your relationship with your work identity vs. your emotional identity?

   > **Pre-filled:** Likely compartmentalized (Firewall extends to work/personal divide).
