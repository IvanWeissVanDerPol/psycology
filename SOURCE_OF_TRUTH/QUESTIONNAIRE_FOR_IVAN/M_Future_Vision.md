## Section M: Future Vision

### M1. The 40-50 Vision

**Draft Answer (Based on Current Trends):**
> **Option A (The Community Hub):** A large house with chosen family (like Alejandro, but expanded). We have shared spaces but separate retreats. We cook together. We know each other's trauma lore. It's a "support group" that lives together.
>
> **Option B (The Kink Household):** A polyamorous or kink-integrated household where "The Engineer" and "Brahm" can coexist openly. I don't have to hide my submissive side. I can be "Neko" in the living room without it being weird.
>
> **Option C (The Professional Commune):** A high-functioning co-living space where we work on projects together (Startup/AI) but also care for each other. Productivity + Intimacy.

1. You mentioned wanting a "chosen family household" at age 40-50. What does this look like?
   [Select or combine]

2. Who's in this household? What's the dynamic?
   **Draft Answer:** People who have seen my "worst" (The Cycle, The Breakdown) and didn't leave. People like Defi and Maga who hold me accountable. People like Nico who offer care. It's a dynamic of radical acceptance + mutual growth.

3. In this vision, are you still The Fixer? Or have you found another way to belong?
   **Option A:** I'm still useful (I fix the wifi), but my belonging doesn't *depend* on it.
   **Option B:** I am the "Heart" of the house, not just the "Hands." I bring warmth, not just solutions.
   **Option C:** I am allowed to be useless. I can have a depressive episode and the house doesn't fall apart.

### M2. What You Want From Life

**Draft Answer (Based on Voice Notes):**
> "mínimo que esté cerca de mí y darte abrazos y darte calor"
>
> **The Simple List:**
> 1.  **Warmth:** "Queda calentito." Not just temperature, but emotional safety.
> 2.  **Connection:** Being seen without the mask.
> 3.  **Safety:** Knowing I won't be ignored or scolded for having needs.
> 4.  **Integration:** Using my brain (AI/Tech) to support my heart, not hide it.
> 5.  **Memories:** Accumulating "good memories and sensations" to counteract the void.

1. From your profile: _"Good memories and sensations. Warmth and connection. To feel less lonely. To feel warm more often."_
   [Your expansion here]

2. What would a "good life" look like for you specifically?
   **Draft Answer:** A life where I don't have to apologize for existing ("pesado"). Where I can ask for a hug without explaining why. Where my work (AI) helps people, and my people help me.
