## Section E: Kink and Intimacy

### E1. Brahm in Daily Life

Integration goal: "Brahm's softness accessible as Ivan"

**Pre-filled from documentation:**

1. Have there been moments when Brahm emerged without explicit permission structures? What triggered it?

   > **Pre-filled:** The "uwu" in text messages may be Brahm leaking through without full permission. The Cookie chat shows asking for help (vulnerable) with "uwu" softening - partial Brahm emergence.

   Other moments? \_\_\_

2. What does Brahm need that Ivan can't ask for?

   > **Pre-filled from Brahm Letter:**
   >
   > - To curl up and be held
   > - Head scratches without asking
   > - To be called "good boy"
   > - To feel like belonging is not conditional on usefulness
   > - To be adored without earning it

   Add: \_\_\_

3. If you could integrate one aspect of Brahm into daily Ivan, what would it be?

   > **Pre-filled:** From Integration Goal: _"I want to be able to ask for care without a permission structure."_

### E2. Receiving vs Giving

You describe being a service sub, finding meaning in being useful. The Fixer pattern manifests here too.

**Pre-filled from documentation:**

1. What's the hardest part about receiving service/care?

   > **Pre-filled from Brahm Letter:** _"Under all the service, the submission, the need to be useful—there's a part of me that's still not sure I'm actually wanted. Not for what I can do, but for who I am."_

   Add: \_\_\_

2. When receiving, does the "pesado" voice still speak? What does it say?

   > **Pre-filled:** From Brahm Letter: _"After a scene, even a good one, there's a voice in my head that asks: 'Was I too intense? Was I a good boy?'"_
   >
   > The voice asks: "Am I too much?"

   What else does it say? \_\_\_

3. What kind of receiving feels safest?

   > **Pre-filled:**
   >
   > - Physical containment (being held tightly)
   > - With explicit permission structure active
   > - When given direct commands ("sit here", "come here")
   > - When the other person is clearly present (not on phone)
