## Section C: Family and Origin

### C1. The Firewall

**Draft Answer (Based on Brahm Letter):**
> "I'll never tell you anything again."
>
> **Option A (Dignity Focus):** The firewall isn't just about privacy; it's about dignity. If I share my inner world, I risk being mocked ("pesado"). If I share nothing, I can't be hurt.
>
> **Option B (The Double Life):** My family gets the "logistic Ivan"—the one who fixes computers. They don't know "Brahm" (the emotional/kink self). They don't know about my HIV status. This compartmentalization is the only way I can exist in that house without exploding.
>
> **Option C (Protection of Them):** Maybe I also protect *them* from truths they can't handle. They couldn't process my reality (kink, poly, HIV) without breaking. I firewall to keep the peace.

1. Has anyone in your family ever tried to get past the firewall? What happened?
   [Your expansion here]

2. If you could make one family member truly understand your emotional world, who would it be and why?
   **Draft Answer:** Probably Kyrian. We work together, she knows me best professionally. But even with her, I wonder if she could handle the full truth (HIV, kink, depression) without freaking out.

3. Is there any part of you that wants to let them in? Or does the firewall serve you well?
   **Option A:** No. The cost is too high. The firewall works.
   **Option B:** Yes, a part of me is lonely and wishes I had a family I didn't have to hide from.
   **Option C:** Only if they could listen without judging/fixing, but they can't, so it's a moot point.

### C2. Mother Dynamics

**Draft Answer (Based on Voice Notes):**
> "mi vieja nunca me escuchaba"
>
> **Option A (The Thermometer):** My mother is the Unpredictable Manager. I learned to read the room temperature instantly. My behavior depends entirely on HER state.
>
> **Option B (The Self-Erasure):** I never learned to ask "How am I feeling?" because the only question that mattered was "How is SHE feeling?" This is why I recreated the dynamic with Laura—I found another unpredictable woman and tried to manage her emotions too.

1. What's your current relationship with your mother like?

2. Do you see the "walking on eggshells" pattern appearing with partners? With Rita? With others?
   **Draft Answer:** YES. It happened with Laura (100%). With Rita... [Did you feel you had to manage her moods too?]. I tend to attract people whose moods take up all the oxygen in the room.

3. What would a non-unpredictable maternal figure look like to you?
   **Draft Answer:** Someone consistent. Someone whose love doesn't depend on her mood. Someone who can hear "I'm sad" without making it about *her* stress.

### C3. Father Dynamics

**Draft Answer (Based on July 2025 Voice Notes):**
> "mi viejo es siempre de mandar y escomandar y decir como tiene que ser"
> "john [father] su mundo es su pc el super el patio nada mas le importa"
> "no me hicieron sentir nada fucking ignore"
>
> **Option A (The Ghost):** My dad isn't mean; he's absent. He's an NPC in his own life, looping between the PC, the supermarket, and the yard. He is physically there but emotionally unreachable.
>
> **Option B (The Drill Sergeant):** When he *is* present, it's to "mandar y escomandar" (command). He doesn't converse; he lectures. He doesn't connect; he corrects.
>
> **Option C (The Neglect Wound):** It's not that he hit me; it's that he didn't see me. I felt "fucking ignored." I learned that to get his attention, I had to be useful (fix the PC) or loud (which got me labeled "pesado"). There was no "just being with dad."

1. Have you ever had an emotional conversation with your father? What happened?
   **Draft Answer:** Never. He doesn't have the language for it. If I try, he turns it into a lecture or a command.

2. What do you wish he would have given you that he didn't?
   **Option A:** Curiosity. asking "Who are you?" instead of telling me "This is how things should be."
   **Option B:** Pride. Not for what I did, but for who I am.
   **Option C:** Protection. Making me feel safe instead of ignored.

3. Do you see yourself replicating his emotional unavailability in any relationships?
   **Draft Answer:** Maybe. "The Firewall" is my version of his "Do Not Disturb." Sometimes I retreat to my PC just like him to avoid dealing with messy emotions.

### C4. Childhood Gaps

**Draft Answer (Based on Profile):**
> **The Pesado Label:** It started early (age 2). I was energetic, curious, maybe a bit much. Instead of channeling that energy, they labeled it "annoying" ("inchabola").
>
> **Option A (The Suppression):** "My aliveness is a burden to others." So I learned to suppress the aliveness (System A) and only let it out in safe, contained spaces (System B/Kink).
>
> **Option B (The Performance):** I tried to be "useful" to make up for being "heavy." If I fix the computer, you can't be mad that I exist.

1. What's your earliest memory of feeling "too much" or "pesado"?
   [Your expansion here]

2. Were there any adults (teachers, relatives, family friends) who made you feel less "pesado"? What was different about them?
   [Your expansion here]

3. What did you do as a child when you needed comfort?
   **Draft Answer:** I went to my room. I fixed things. I played video games. I learned to self-soothe because seeking comfort from others was risky.
