**Pre-filled from documentation:**

1. On a typical day, how lonely do you feel? (1-10)

   > **Pre-filled:** From profile: _"I can be surrounded by people and still feel cold. This is not something I've accepted. I want to change it."_
   >
   > Estimated: 5-7/10 average

   Your actual rating: \_\_\_

2. What makes the loneliness better, even temporarily?

   > **Pre-filled:**
   >
   > - Physical warmth (cuddles, being held)
   > - Nico/Nyx experiences ("like finding a warm cave")
   > - Kink contexts where Brahm can exist
   > - Genuine acknowledgment of who you are (not what you do)

   Add: \_\_\_

3. What makes it worse?

   > **Pre-filled:**
   >

4. When you imagine "not being lonely," what does that look like specifically?

### D2. The HIV Diagnosis (Nov 2025)

**Pre-filled from documentation:**

1. How are you processing this? (Only answer what you're comfortable with)

   > **Pre-filled:** You're channeling it into productive action (HIV research project with Cookie). This is intellectualization defense but also genuine processing. The Cookie chat shows you reaching out for research contacts.

   > **Pre-filled:**
   >
   > - Family: NO ONE knows

   >
   > From Brahm Letter: _"Not even my family knows this."_

   Who else knows? How did it go? \_\_\_

3. Has this changed how you see relationships, intimacy, or your future?
