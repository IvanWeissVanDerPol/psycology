Section D: Current State
D1. The Loneliness
You describe persistent loneliness despite apparent contentment. The "void black wolf in the snow" metaphor.

Pre-filled from documentation:

On a typical day, how lonely do you feel? (1-10)

Pre-filled: From profile: "I can be surrounded by people and still feel cold. This is not something I've accepted. I want to change it."

Estimated: 5-7/10 average

Your actual rating: 5/10 depending on when i got warmth last?
At home with ale and kiki i some times am like hmmmm def i wanna cuddle sarah / nico/nyx
And waiting for saturday to get tied up

What makes the loneliness better, even temporarily?

Pre-filled:

Physical warmth (cuddles, being held)
Nico/Nyx experiences ("like finding a warm cave")
Kink contexts where Brahm can exist
Genuine acknowledgment of who you are (not what you do)
Company with someone i have a deepr relationship with

What makes it worse?

Pre-filled:

Being ignored while serving (Father wound)
Unpredictable/cold energy (Mother wound)
Service going unacknowledged
Feeling like a burden
Feeling alone or ignored
Being postponed and delayed when i actually ask for help
Being with someone and not feeling like they are here with me

When you imagine "not being lonely," what does that look like specifically?

Pre-filled from "What Ivan Wants": "Waking up together, making breakfast, working separately, cooking dinner together. Someone who will take care of me when sick. See me cry and respond with love."

Add: \_\_\_
I like the mental image of the album of Hey Little Baby from the artist Dope Lemon
Being with a lover and spening time together in a caring way and feeling the love and warmth

D2. The HIV Diagnosis (Nov 2025)
This is recent. Only mentioned in the profile as U=U status.

Pre-filled from documentation:

How are you processing this? (Only answer what you're comfortable with)

Pre-filled: You're channeling it into productive action (HIV research project with Cookie). This is intellectualization defense but also genuine processing.

When i found out i was really bad
I was in my most depressed state
I felt unlovable untouchable toxic and radioactive
After treatment and talking with people and research i can be a bit more chill
I can acept that life goes on and that you can live chill
But i still stress and overthink about mentioning it to partners before anything
It was good to talk with adri and defi when we talked
And that everyone i mentioned it to has been so nice and warm
Sarah nico nyx alex dint get turned off and were ok with me on treatment and gave me kisses and hugs and warmth i felt so nice and happy

Who knows? How did telling people go?

Family: NO ONE knows
Friends: Some (Cookie,ale,pazzu,adri,defi,jonathan,sue,alex)
Partners: Nico, nyx,sarah,alex ,lourdes

Has this changed how you see relationships, intimacy, or your future?
Your answer: I stress and worry about explaining and giving context before we escalate and do more things etc

D3. Current Relationship Status
Profile says "In relationship with Nico (polyamorous context)"

Pre-filled from documentation:

What's the current structure? (primary, casual, etc.)
Nico has a wife ceci
Nico has a bunny nyx
Nico has me as a bunny
Nyx has me as bunny
Sarah has sex with me
Alex kissed and is horny with me
Lourdes we kissed and hug and sleep together no sex
I have no official gf dom etc
Im just a friend

Are you satisfied with this arrangement?

     Yes
    At most i want to talk with alex more she feels like a me person

What's missing, if anything?

Pre-filled: From Integration Goal: Wanting Brahm's softness accessible outside of permission structures. Wanting to feel warm "more often" (implies not enough currently).

What's missing?i dont feel i miss anything
Maybe more nights of sleeping cuddles instead of sex and going home?(sarah)
But its still nice and warm with sarah i visit her also in her home and cuddle and sleep on her belly and cuddle so nice
