P2. Kink and Orientation
Pre-filled from documentation:

You wrote: "Brahm isn't a character I play. Brahm is the real one." How does your sexual/kink orientation connect to your sense of authentic self?

Pre-filled: Kink is currently the primary access point for vulnerability. Brahm = authentic self, only accessible through permission structures.

Bram is how i am in the core a needy cuddly raccoon that wants to get praise and kissed

Could Brahm exist without kink? Or is kink essential to who Brahm is?

Pre-filled: Integration Goal suggests wanting Brahm without requiring kink permission structures. So: Brahm could exist without kink, theoretically.

Yes i can be cute without sex
And aftercare is the best part of bdsm
