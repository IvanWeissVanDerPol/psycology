The big one:

"I want to learn how to exist in a room without fixing anything and not feel like a burden."

Pre-filled from documentation:

Have you ever experienced this? Even briefly?

Pre-filled: The Nico/Nyx experience comes closest - "happy tears," receiving without earning. Brief moments of belonging without performing.

Other moments? Pool party with alex

What would need to be true for this to feel possible?

Pre-filled from Brahm Letter: Explicit permission ("You can be annoying with me"), physical invitation to closeness, consistent reassurance that wants the messy parts too.
