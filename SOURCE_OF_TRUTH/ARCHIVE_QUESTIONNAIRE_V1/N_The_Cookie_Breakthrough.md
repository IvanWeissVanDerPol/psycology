Section N: The Cookie Breakthrough
N1. Why Asking Worked There
You asked Cookie for help (rare). Understanding WHY is therapeutically important.

Pre-filled from documentation:

In Dec 2025, you asked Cookie: "Por si acaso conoces de tus clases gente en bio informatica? Uwu" - Why was this possible?

Pre-filled analysis:

Context was intellectual (research) not emotional
Cookie positioned as resource-holder, not caregiver
Framed as "random question" - low stakes
Used "uwu" softening but STILL ASKED

Is this analysis accurate? [yes ] / What made it possible: im working on an HIV research project
And she has friends in medical fields

What felt different about asking Cookie vs. asking anyone else?

Nothing in particular she has more expertise in the area than me and more contacts so i should ask her

Could you ask Cookie for EMOTIONAL help? What would change?

Pre-filled: Likely harder - intellectual/practical help ≠ emotional help.

She helpd me a lot
When i was sad after lauras break up but before knowing i had hiv
She hugged me and we sleept cuddling and it felt amazing and warm
I thanked her a lot for that i needed to remember what it felt like to sleep with a hug
Laura never slept like this with me
