Section M: Future Vision
M1. The 40-50 Vision
Draft Answer (Based on Current Trends):

Option A (The Community Hub): A large house with chosen family (like Alejandro, but expanded). We have shared spaces but separate retreats. We cook together. We know each other's trauma lore. It's a "support group" that lives together.

Option B (The Kink Household): A polyamorous or kink-integrated household where "The Engineer" and "Brahm" can coexist openly. I don't have to hide my submissive side. I can be "Neko" in the living room without it being weird.

Option C (The Professional Commune): A high-functioning co-living space where we work on projects together (Startup/AI) but also care for each other. Productivity + Intimacy.

You mentioned wanting a "chosen family household" at age 40-50. What does this look like? A mix of all 3 options mostly a and B but i would def love to help with projects on friends

Who's in this household? What's the dynamic? Draft Answer: People who have seen my "worst" (The Cycle, The Breakdown) and didn't leave. People like Defi who hold me accountable. People like Nico who offer care. It's a dynamic of radical acceptance + mutual growth.

In this vision, are you still The Fixer? Or have you found another way to belong? Option A: I'm still useful (I fix the wifi), but my belonging doesn't depend on it.

M2. What You Want From Life
Draft Answer (Based on Voice Notes):

"mínimo que esté cerca de mí y darte abrazos y darte calor"

The Simple List:

Warmth: "Queda calentito." Not just temperature, but emotional safety.
Connection: Being seen without the mask.
Safety: Knowing I won't be ignored or scolded for having needs.
Integration: Using my brain (AI/Tech) to support my heart, not hide it.
Memories: Accumulating "good memories and sensations" to counteract the void.

From your profile: "Good memories and sensations. Warmth and connection. To feel less lonely. To feel warm more often." [Your expansion here]

What would a "good life" look like for you specifically?
A never ending vacation with friends cuddles and happy times
Everyone can chill and do their own thing but come together when needed
I imagine chilling on a beach or lake with them and having a nice time and relaxing and smiling and cuddling talking about life and projects and the biggest issues we have are like what to eat /cook hashasa
