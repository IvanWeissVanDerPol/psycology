Section L: Friendships and Social Dynamics
L1. Male vs Female Friendships
Pre-filled from documentation:

The analysis shows The Fixer operates with Jonatan (male) the same way as with Magali (female). Is your relationship pattern truly gender-neutral?

Yes i dont care about gender just about vibes

Are there differences in how you relate to male vs female friends?

Im bisexual - gender may not be the relevant variable.

L2. Group vs Individual
Pre-filled from documentation:

How is it different being in group contexts (Kansas exchange) vs one-on-one?

Pre-filled: Kansas exchange (Lucia, Ideline) - group context may have buffered Fixer intensity. Time-limited (3 months) with natural endpoint.

Both are nice
With a group its nice to do therapy time and get everyones perspective and cuddle
One on one maybe we can talk more deeper?

Where do you feel more yourself - in groups or one-on-one?

    One on one?

L3. The Defi/Maga Support
Your friends said: "Entre amixes nos vamos a subir los estandares" (Between friends we're going to raise standards)

How does it feel to have friends actively committed to helping you set boundaries?

This is external accountability - a documented need for closing the knowing-acting gap.

Also maga fought with defi and adri and isnt talking to the group and defi wasnt there for me so i dont think this applyins any more?

Def i will try to remember and keep my standards higher
But i dont feel i can count on them for this

Do you believe they can actually help? Or does the "pesado" voice worry you're burdening them?

Pre-filled: Unknown.

Your answer: if they tell me the negative side and point out issues maybe yes?
