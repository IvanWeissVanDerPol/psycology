Section J: Body and Physical Needs
J1. Touch Starvation
Draft Answer (Based on Voice Note Evidence):

"que si me siento sad, este así para mí me abrace de atrás, me da un beso en la frente y queda calentito"

Option A (The Containment Need): My need for touch is high, specifically for containment. I don't just want sex; I want to be held. The specific image is a hug from behind (being protected) and warmth ("calentito").

Option B (The Verbal Bypass): When I'm sad, I lose the ability to speak ("no sé fucking hablar"). In those moments, words don't work. I need physical pressure to ground me. Touch is the only language I can receive when System A (logic) shuts down.

Option C (The Proof): "necesito llevar alguien muy a la puta... el tipo este no más a mi lado". It's about presence. The touch proves I'm real and I'm here and I'm not alone. If you're touching me, you haven't abandoned me.

How often do you feel physically touch-starved? Draft Answer: Often (6/10). I have "skin hunger." Even when I'm around people, if there's no contact, I feel cold.

What kind of touch do you crave most? Option A: Heavy pressure. Being squeezed. Grounding. Option B: Gentle / Soft. Head scratches, "mimitos," forehead kisses. Reassurance. Option C: Passive contact. Just sitting on the couch with legs touching. "Heads resting together" (like with Lujan).
All of the options

Outside of kink contexts, how often do you receive meaningful physical affection? Answer: Historically low, but improving. With Nico (D/s dynamic), I can ask for "mimitos" because "Neko" is allowed to need it. With Mike, I get professional massage (transactional but physical). But in general adult friendships, it feels unsafe to ask without a "reason" or a "permission structure" (like being drunk or being "Neko").

J2. Marks and Pain
Draft Answer (Based on Brahm Letter):

"I want to carry marks. Bite marks on my arms. Hickeys. Scratches."

Option A (The Receipt): A mark is a receipt. It's proof of purchase. It says "Ivan was here, and someone interacted with him intensely enough to leave a trace." Without marks, my brain gaslights me into thinking maybe they didn't really care.

Option B (The Ownership): I want to belong to someone. A mark is a tag. It says "Taken." It relieves me of the burden of self-ownership for a while.

Option C (The Intensity): Physical pain cuts through the emotional numbness. A bruise is a sharp sensation that forces me into my body and out of my head. It's grounding.

Why do marks matter to you? B and C

Is this about ownership, evidence of care, or something else? Care , its hot, it looks nice and sexy , i can feel it and see it in my week and remember
