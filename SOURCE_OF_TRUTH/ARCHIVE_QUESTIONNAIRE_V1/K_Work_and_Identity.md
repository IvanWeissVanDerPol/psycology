Section K: Work and Identity
K1. Professional Self
Draft Answer (Based on Voice Note Analysis):

"I genuinely believe I'm way above every other guy... Full service maid butler with main character syndrome."

Option A (The Contrast Identity): I define myself by being the opposite of "typical Paraguayan men" - they don't cook, I cook. They don't clean, I clean. They don't cuddle, I cuddle. No hygiene, no care, no respect. I do the opposite of all of this. It's not just about being useful; it's about being fundamentally different from (and better than) the cultural norm. If I'm the "full service maid butler," nobody can compare me to those "horrible heteros."

Option B (The Superiority Defense): I genuinely believe I'm way above every other guy. "Main character syndrome." I work hard to prove I am indispensable. If I am the most competent, most caring, most domestic person in the room - if I cook and clean and cuddle and communicate - nobody can call me 'pesado'. I weaponize being "not like other men" to prove my value. Being handsome and middle-upper class helps, but it's the service that really sets me apart.

Option C (The Full Service Trap): I am "way above every other guy... Full service maid butler." But it's exhausting being the one who does everything - cooking, cleaning, caring, communicating. Sometimes I hate being "The Guy Who Does It All." But I don't know who I am if I'm not fundamentally different from (and better than) every other hetero man in Paraguay.
You co-founded an AI consultancy startup with your sister Kyrian. How does The Engineer show up at work? Draft Answer: He shows up as the hyper-competent problem solver. He anticipates bottlenecks. He automates the boring stuff. He ensures nothing breaks so nobody has a reason to be mad.

Does work feel like another arena where you need to earn your place Option B: No, work is the ONE place I feel secure because I know I'm good at it. It's relationships that feel precarious.
Also i am the boss so… chill jasjasj

What's your relationship with your work identity vs. your emotional identity? Draft Answer: They are completely separate. Work Ivan (Engineer) is efficient, loud, confident. Emotional Ivan (Brahm) is quiet, needy, hidden.
The engineer is happy bram can get affection

Identity Contrast - Ivan vs. "Typical Paraguayan Man"

Ivan's Self-Description:

"Heteros in Paraguay are horrible. No hygiene, no care, no cuddles, no respect, no communication, lots of lies and bad vibes. Don't cook, don't clean, don't do anything more than drinking and sports and wasting time.

I do the opposite of all of this. I am told I am handsome. I come from middle upper class (I don't care about money, I use it for making people around me nice and to share things)."

Analysis:

Hygiene & Care: Explicitly values cleanliness, nurturing, physical affection
Domestic Competence: Cooks, cleans, manages household (complete opposite of stereotype)
Communication: Values respectful, honest communication
Money Philosophy: Middle-upper class background but uses money for service/sharing, not status
Physical Identity: "Handsome" - positive self-image regarding appearance
The Contrast as Identity: Being "not like other guys" is central to self-concept

Clinical Note: This contrast serves multiple functions:

Justifies The Fixer behavior ("I actually help unlike other men")
Explains service-giving ("I'm different/better")
Reinforces self-worth through comparison
May create pressure to maintain "perfect partner" image

K2. AI Interest
Draft Answer (Based on Jan 2026 Voice Notes):

"hacer un documento con antigravity..."

Option A (The Bridge): I use AI because it bridges the gap between my brain (System A) and my heart (System B). I have the 'autism of not knowing how to express myself', but I speak Tech fluently. AI translates my pain into code I can debug.

Option B (The Safe Listener): AI doesn't judge. AI doesn't get tired. AI doesn't think I'm 'pesado' if I send 50 voice notes. It's the ultimate safe container. It allows me to be "too much" without consequences.

Option C (The Solution): I see life as a system to be optimized. If I'm unhappy, it's a bug. AI helps me find the root cause and patch it. It's not just therapy; it's debugging my source code.

What drew you to use AI for this self-analysis?
It was more efficient for giving context to my therapist and to help my doms understand me

Is there something about AI (non-judgmental, always available, doesn't have needs) that makes vulnerability easier? Answer: 100%. The "pesado" wound doesn't trigger with AI because AI has infinite patience. I can finally speak without watching for the other person's "annoyed face."

What's your relationship with your work identity vs. your emotional identity?

Pre-filled: Likely compartmentalized (Firewall extends to work/personal divide).

Your answer: not sure

You built this psychological profile using AI.

What drew you to use AI for this self-analysis?
