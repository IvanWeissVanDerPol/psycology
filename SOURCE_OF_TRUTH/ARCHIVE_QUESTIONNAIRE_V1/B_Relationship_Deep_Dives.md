Section B: Relationship Deep-Dives
B1. Rita
The Rita chat shows softer communication, more "uwu" usage, and focus on cooking/cuddling/domestic activities.

Pre-filled from documentation:

What made/makes Rita different from other romantic interests?

Pre-filled: Early romantic phase (Oct-Dec 2022). More "uwu" energy, cuddly, domestic activities (Korean chicken, apple tart). Service as love language was reciprocated more.

    Not sure we talked a bit randomly and then fell out of touch when i was on vacation to USA and didnt connect when i got back

I remember her foundly
She was soft and caring also a bit more vanilla but nice

Your answer: \_\_\_

With Rita, did you feel more able to be "Brahm" than with other partners? Why/why not?

Pre-filled: Unknown - but the chat shows softer communication patterns than with Laura.

Your answer: \_\_\_

B2. The Pattern of Staying Too Long
With Laura, you stayed 7 months past wanting to leave. The Lourdes chat shows awareness of intentionally "killing romantic feelings" early.

Pre-filled from documentation:

Is there a pattern of staying in situations longer than you should?

Pre-filled:

[x] Yes, consistently

Evidence: Laura (7 months too long), recognized pattern recreation with mother but didn't act.

    Im not sure if its a pattern
    Laura def i stayed too long
    But other gfs it ended when i felt i should end
    With laura i felt to bad bc of her mother hospitalization

What would need to be true for you to leave a relationship when you first want to?

Pre-filled: From Laura analysis: You stayed because you "didn't want to feel like the bad guy" and her mother was hospitalized. The Fixer couldn't "abandon" someone who needed him.

Need: Permission to prioritize yourself? External accountability? Recognition that staying isn't helping?

Your answer:
Def Permission to prioritize yourself? External accountability? Recognition that staying isn't helping?
Noticing that im repeating pattenrs or that they are like my fam
Noticing that im doing everything in the relationship
Feeling that the other person is complacent and not doing anything from their life

With Lourdes, you describe "intentionally killing romantic feelings while maintaining care." Do you do this often? What triggers this self-protection?

Pre-filled: You maintained FWB with Lourdes for ~2 years (Jun 2022 - Nov 2023) specifically keeping it non-romantic. When Laura relationship started, Lourdes FWB naturally ended.

What triggers the self-protection?
With fwb i kill my romantic feelings so i dont get attached too much
I can still be cute and caring and hug massage kiss and cuddle
But in my head if i have killed the felings i can be chill and not overthink etc
Just enjoy my time with the person and make us both happy and create amazing memories together
Fwb breakup hurts less that an gf breakup

B3. Nico/Nyx
The profile describes Nico/Nyx as "proof that receiving is possible" - like finding a warm cave.

Pre-filled from documentation:

What specifically does Nico/Nyx do differently that allows Brahm to emerge?

Pre-filled from Brahm Letter patterns: Likely provides explicit permission, physical containment, direct invitation to closeness, acknowledgment without requiring you to earn it first.

When you received care from them, what was harder:

Trusting it would continue
Maybe this a bit?
I try and make myself the best and most awsome rope bunny
I made them an amazing meal and try to interact and do things with them more
Maybe i feel like if i do all this extra nice things they will notice me more and praise me / when im not there doing anything they will notice and want to invite me again / more

Could you receive similar care from someone without the kink permission structure? What would need to be different?

Pre-filled: From your Integration Goal: "I want to be able to ask for care without a permission structure." This suggests you're aware it's currently tied to kink context.

What would need to be different? \_\_\_
Im not sure what would need to be different
Maybe being with someone i feel is calm and we can talk without t leading to exploding emotions and drama
Instead to an actual solution or to not worry more about the thing
Maybe instead of me asking they noticing and asking me what i need
Maybe they can give me options for me to use or suggest an alternative?
